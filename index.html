            Record Keepers

          </div>

          <div class="section6-desc col-md-12  text-justify"><p>Dear Blessed Seeker,</p>
            <p>We are delighted you have brought yourself thus far, and you now see the opportunity before you. An Akashic Record Reading from Aurora means you will be engaging in a highly committed process, one that is not to be taken lightly. </p>

            <p>Although this highly advanced work is life-changing and reality-shifting, it is intensive and requires an active response on your part for it to lastingly transform you--and so you must authentically want this change. </p>

            <p>Please consider: Are you prepared to follow through? Although this is a joyful path of expansion and awareness, it is also demanding.
            </p>

            <p>But know that Aurora is unlike any other Reader, in that she is always available to lovingly support you once you have come to her. She is never far from your field once you two work together in this committed fashion. Several of her clients have become treasured friends! Yet it is important to be clear regarding your intentions before your engage in this process.
            </p>
            <p>Are you able to let go of the familiar burdens and obstacles that you hold on to at this time? For that which is, at best, unknown?

            </p>
            <p>We ask this because once you purchase, you will be directly activating all of Aurora's gifts, talents, skills and training in the highest and best way possible for you, and Aurora is totally on-board and will be in your corner. However, Aurora is committed to only doing this for those Divine Light Beings who are a good match -- that is, in alignment with the Divine Light Being that she herself is, prior to your purchasing this contribution to your Ascension Journey.


            </p>

            <p>Therefore, we ask that you do not be shy -- email Aurora responses to these three questions below. Email AkashicGuide@yahoo.com and she will check in with her guidance as well. If you forget to do this part, do not worry -- Aurora will write you personally!


            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Why have you been called to do this work?</li>
              <li>What do you hope to gain by specifically accessing your Akashic Records?</li>
              <li>What is your mission on the planet at this time? If unknown, please describe your goals for your spiritual, emotional, physical, and/or mental wellness and growth.  </li>

            </ol>

            <p>A magical journey awaits.
              Thank you for reading.</p>
